   Wow! This problem is kind of tricky. If you're ready to put your thinking cap on, brace yourself and good luck! Otherwise, you can skip it by now and return any time later
  </div>Write a program that reads a text (in the UTF-8) from the standard input. The program must count the frequency of words in the text and print the 10 most frequent words.
  <p></p> 
  <p>A word is a sequence of characters consisting only of digits and letters. For example, the string "Functions bring happiness!" has three words: "Functions", "bring", "happiness".</p> 
  <p>The counting words should be case-insensitive, i.e. "Functions", "functions" and "FUNCTIONS" are the same word. Output words in the lower case.</p> 
  <p>If the text has less than 10 unique words, output as many as there are.</p> 
  <p>If some words in the text have the same frequency, order them lexicographically as well. For details, see here (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order</a>).</p> 
  <p>The problem has a beautiful solution using streams without any loops and conditional operators. Try to write it.</p>
