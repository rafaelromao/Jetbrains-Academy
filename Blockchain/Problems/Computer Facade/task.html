  <p>In this task, you will implement almost a&nbsp;full code. Your computer is some kind of a facade for you as a user, or developers put it, a client<em>.&nbsp;</em>Let's create a simple <em>ComputerFacade&nbsp;</em>with <em>Processor, Monitor and Keyboard</em>&nbsp;subsystems. When you turn on this computer,&nbsp;<em>Processor</em> will start&nbsp;first, then <em>Monitor</em> and finally&nbsp;<em>Keyboard</em>. But be careful, because your keyboard has backlight and the turning off order should be correct!</p>
